The warfarin dose, and the INR reading for that time, 
-and the action taken on the INR reading all need to be on one screen but the click of one button if possible.  
The INR should auto populate.  
One should have the option of having an entire overview, which is already a function of the management section. 
-Having the patient's telephone number/numbers available, the strength of that tablet, 
and a link to the billing screen to Bill the warfarin management is also a must.  I would much rather have this than the flowsheet.
