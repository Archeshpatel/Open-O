This document is for automated checkouts for the purpose of daily builds. (We will use the Integrator project as an example here.)

Install prerequisites like Java, Tomcat, Maven, MySql.

Install the server once like a normal deployment with database configured and everything and all working.

Then... the following is to automate redeployment :

0) make sure you setup a good working directory like ~/myoscar/git
1) manually clone a repository : git clone git://192.168.1.241/myoscar_server

2) make need a cron job that (automated_deploy.sh is a script to help)
	a) updates repository
	b) clean compiles (including cleaning maven repo ~/.m2/repository)
	c) resets the database
	d) if build succeeds deploy
