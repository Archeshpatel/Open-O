This document is for automated checkouts for the purpose of daily builds. (We will use the Integrator project as an example here.)

0) make sure you setup a good working directory like /opt/git
1) manually clone a repository : git clone git://oscarmcmaster.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/oscarmcmaster/integrator

2) make need a cron job that 
	a) updates repository
	b) clean compiles (including cleaning maven repo ~/.m2/repository)
	c) if build succeeds deploy
