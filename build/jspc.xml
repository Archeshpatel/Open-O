	<!--
		Generally speaking there's no need to precompile jsp's. Jasper is 
		fairly quick and efficient anyways so dynamic compilation is fine
		and offers the ability to change things on the fly. The reason 
		we want to statically compile here is just for the sake of 
		error checking, i.e. catching jsp's that don't compile - at compile
		time rather than at run time. This will also help for automated
		build systems like Hudson to check that the commited jsp's compile.
		
		REQUIRES:
		This build script requires that the normal build be run and 
		the expectation is that oscar/build/tmp/oscar.war was built and exists.
		This script requires the environment variable CATALINA_HOME to be set,
		this was tested against tomcat 6.0.18 and requires a version that
		has the jasper compiler in it (5.0 versions did not, look for comments
		in the code below for changes required to support 5.5).
